Delays in identifying and returning items
Missing or inaccurate records
Difficulty in tracking or matching lost and found items
Increased frustration for users searching for their belongings
A simple, reliable, and user-friendly digital system is needed to streamline the reporting, tracking, and management of lost and found items while reducing human errors and improving accessibility.
